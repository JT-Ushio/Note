1. In recent years, the development of ~~deep learning~~ has provided new opportunities for ~~dialogue generation~~. (近年来，xxx的发展为xxx提供了新的机会。)
2. Train a more language-agnostic encoder by injecting artificial noises (通过注入人工噪声训练更加语言无关的编码器。)
3. We also provide extensive ablation studies on pre-Trained embedding, synthetic data, vocabulary size, and parameter freezing for a better understanding of NMT transfer. (我们还提供关于预训练嵌入，合成数据，词表大小和参数固定的广泛消融研究，以便更好地理解NMT迁移。)
4. Despite recent success of NMT, its major improvements and optimizations cannot be easily applied to low-resource language pairs. (尽管最近NMT取得了成功，但其主要的改进和优化不能轻易应用于低资源语言对。)
5. Basic training procedure of NMT does not function well with only a handful of bilingual data, while collecting bilingual resource is arduous for many languages. (NMT的基础训练过程只有少数双语数据才能很好地发挥作用，而收集双语资源对于许多语言来说是艰巨的。)
